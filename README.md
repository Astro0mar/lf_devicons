# File and directory icons for lf (list files)


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirala/lfimg/master/screenshot.png)


## Prerequisites
This plugin uses glyphs from a patched NERDfont. So in order for this plugin to work you need to
install a NERDfont and set it as the default font for your terminal.

This plugin is inspired by Alexander Jeurissen's ranger_devicons which can be found here:
https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons

The vifm equivalent can be found here: https://github.com/cirala/vifm_devicons

## Installation instructions
There are two ways to install this, the choice is entirely yours but I recommend the latter
because when updates are released you simply need to update a git repo instead of messing
with the actual vifmrc file.

Append the following line to your ~/.config/lf/lfrc file:

    source /path/to/your/repos/lf_devicons/favicons

Restart lf to take affect.
